# Student Skill Development Prediction System

## AI & Machine Learning Mini Project

### Project Overview

The **Student Skill Development Prediction System** is a Machine Learning project developed using Python. The system analyzes student academic performance and technical skills to predict placement eligibility and classify students into different skill levels.

This project uses:

- Supervised Learning (Random Forest Classifier)
- Unsupervised Learning (K-Means Clustering)

The project also generates charts, saves prediction history, and provides recommendations for student improvement. The implementation follows the AI & Machine Learning Mini Project assignment requirements, including dataset preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. fileciteturn0file0
